# Colocalisation Of Two Channels On Stack [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/371705547.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/371705547)


Matlab script generating a user friendly interface to calculate the colocalisation of 2 channels.  
The user can select a stack of separated images for 2 channels and define an area to analyse within the images.
A threshold for each channel is then chosen by the user to apply on every opened images.
The script will calculate Manders coeficients using the threshold selected, the Pearson coefficient and the percentage of each channel in the other one.
The user need to save the generated data manually.
